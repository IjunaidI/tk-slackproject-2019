Aleem ( student-showcase page ) is missing anchor tags on his sidebar therefore links are not working on it.

Nice work but not pixel perfect is missing fonts and code structure can be improved and I saw the overuse of the "figure" tag.
But still really good attempt and provided the project on time good job. He is missing anchor tags on his sidebar therefore links are not working on it.

### Khadija Tul Kubra

Really good job here design may not be pixel perfect but her code structure was really good just the style of the reply part is missing
but she informed me before about she having some internet issue but still she did great.
Her "class" names and html strucutre was pretty good comparision of other students. Overall Good attempt.

## General review

In 2 months I see great progress here that's abvious some students may not be as Good as others but if we see the overall progress
it is going really great and I can see some students have pretty good potential now it all just depends on there hardwork.
These projects were Good but still Incomplete which dosents make sense after the given time of a whole week.
Even some of the students had already nearly completed the app in the class.
That show's that really few have spend time at home on the project which is not a good practice.
From my end they should have completed it until now specially these 3 students as they were really good but they didn't gave 
enough time on there tasks at home.

Except the part of working and practicing at home they all have shown good progress.
