Nice work but not pixel perfect is missing fonts and code structure can be improved and I saw the overuse of the "<figure>" tag.
But still really good attempt and provided the project on time good job. He is missing anchor tags on his sidebar therefore links are not working on it.

### Khadija Tul Kubra

Really good job here design may not be pixel perfect but her code structure was really good just the style of the reply part is missing
but she informed me before about she having some internet issue but still she did great.
Her "class" names and html strucutre was pretty good comparision of other students. Overall Good attempt.
